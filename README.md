# Guess the Number Game
This is a simple command line implementation of the "Guess the Number" game, written in Python. The program generates a random number for the user to guess and provides feedback on the user's guesses until the correct number is guessed.

##  Usage

To use the program, users must first clone the repository and navigate to the appropriate directory. Then, the program can be run from the command line by using the following command:

```
python3 guess_the_number.py
```

This will start the game and prompt the user to make a guess between a range of 1 and 100 (this range can be modified in the code to suit your needs). The program will then provide feedback on the user's guess, indicating if the guess is too high or too low.

##  Gameplay

The user has a limited number of guesses to correctly guess the number. The program will keep track of the number of guesses and display it after each guess. Once the user correctly guesses the number, the game will end and display the number of guesses it took.

##  Note

This program is intended for entertainment and educational purposes only. It is designed to be a simple and fun way to learn and practice basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input.

##  Requirements

Python 3.x
